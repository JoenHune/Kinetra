# Design Phase

Based on the research findings, propose concrete improvements to Kinetra.

## Tasks

1. Review the research references from the previous phase.
2. Identify 1–3 actionable improvements ranked by impact.
3. For each improvement, design:
   - New or modified test case(s)
   - API changes (concept requirements, new types)
   - Implementation sketch (algorithm pseudocode)

## Output Format

Return a structured plan:
```json
{
  "improvements": [
    {
      "title": "...",
      "priority": 1,
      "test_cases": ["description of test"],
      "api_changes": "brief description",
      "pseudocode": "step-by-step outline"
    }
  ]
}
```
